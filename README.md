[![lint](https://github.com/zacharymplace/creative-lab/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/zacharymplace/creative-lab/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

A sandbox for experiments across **words, sound, and visuals**.  
This is where Z$ plays with ideas before they become polished projects.  

---

## 🧪 Lab Philosophy
- Low pressure, high curiosity.  
- Nothing has to be finished — everything is iteration.  
- Treat this repo as a sketchbook: commit experiments, drafts, half-ideas.  

---

## 🔖 Areas of Focus

### ✍️ Poetry / Posts
- Drafts of LinkedIn series (e.g., *Creative Recovery*).  
- Lyric ideas, snippets, or poetic fragments.  
- Future: organized into seasons/series.  

### 🎵 Sound / Music Experiments
- DJ crate seeds (*Booty Shakers*, *Sad Pit Anthems*, etc.).  
- Patch notes for synth design.  
- Song candidate lists for mixing.  

### 🎨 Visuals
- OBS overlays (Starting Soon, Just Chatting, etc.).  
- Cover art concepts.  
- Design snippets and references.  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Add first draft post (*Creative Recovery*).  
- [ ] Seed one crate list (*Booty Shakers Vol. 1* or *Sad Pit Anthems*).  
- [ ] Stub OBS overlays notes.  
- [ ] Document a lightweight contribution guide.  

---

## 🤝 Contributing
This is Z$’s personal lab.  
- PRs: unlikely.  
- Issues: use for idea parking.  
- Rule: experiments > polish.
