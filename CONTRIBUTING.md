# 🤝 Contributing to Creative Lab

Welcome to **creative-lab**, Z$’s sandbox.  
This repo is not about polish — it’s about *experiments, drafts, and fragments*.  

---

## 🧪 Core Principles
- **Experiments > Polish** → commit raw ideas, refine later.  
- **Cross-pollinate** → link words, sound, and visuals whenever possible.  
- **Low pressure** → no need for perfect formatting or finished work.  
- **Document the vibe** → even a fragment is worth saving if it sparks.  

---

## 📓 Commit Guidelines
- Keep commits small and descriptive.  
- Suggested style:  
  - `poetry: add draft post on X`  
  - `sound: seed crate Y`  
  - `visuals: stub overlay notes`  
  - `docs: update index with new links`  

---

## 🔗 Workflow
1. **Seed** → drop in a fragment, crate, or visual.  
2. **Link** → connect it to another pillar (words ↔ sound ↔ visuals).  
3. **Index** → update [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) if it’s a major new addition.  

---

## 🚫 What’s *Not* Needed
- Formal code reviews.  
- PRs from others (this is a solo sandbox).  
- Perfect structure before committing.  

---

⚡ *Think of this repo like a sketchbook — commit first, polish later.*
