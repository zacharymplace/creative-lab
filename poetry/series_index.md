## ðŸ”® Future Series (Concepts)

### Systems as Poetry
- Notes: treating technical systems like stanzas, READMEs as modern haiku.  
- Cross-pollination: pull fragments from [One-Liners](fragments/one_liners.md).  
- Visual tie: structured layout / grid-based moodboards.  

### Sound as Ritual
- Notes: playlists and crates as rites; bass drops as thresholds.  
- Cross-pollination: [Booty Shakers Vol. 1](../sound/crates/booty_shakers_vol1.md).  
- Visual tie: OBS overlay states as ritual spaces.  

### Notes to Self
- Fragments & aphorisms (collected in [One-Liners](fragments/one_liners.md)).  
- Could spin into micro-posts or paired visuals.
