## Draft Thought
Sometimes creativity doesn’t vanish — it just hides under layers of fatigue, deadlines, and the noise of routine.  
Recovery isn’t about forcing output. It’s about building conditions where energy can return: rest, play, and systems that support flow.  

---

## Notes to Self
- Tie this to *systems-building as creative scaffolding* (LifeOS, repo work, DJ crates).  
- Use a metaphor: *like re-stringing a bass after it’s sat in the case too long*.  
- Keep tone reflective but practical — this is about recovery you can design.  

---

## Future Directions
- Post format: short LinkedIn entry (150–250 words).  
- Add 2–3 “takeaway” lines for readers (small rituals they can try).  
- Maybe pair with a playlist link (*Creative Reset Sessions*?).
