## ⏱️ BPM / Energy Notes
- Aim **130–170 BPM** feel (or half-time equivalents).
- Sequence arcs: *Tension → Break → Release singalong*.

## 🔄 Mix Tips
- Use **half-time drops** to reset breath, then slam.
- Anchor transitions with recognizable intros (e.g., “Welcome Home”).
- Keep 2–3 “surprise optimism” tracks to lift the pit mid-set.

## 📓 To-Test Live
- Which tracks sustain vs. stall after the chorus?
- Where does the crowd naturally pick up the vocal?
- Do we need a mid-crate tempo dip for contrast?

⚡ *Goal: 20–30 keepers, road-tested across 2–3 sessions.*
