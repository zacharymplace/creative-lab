# 🔖 Cycle Name Cheat Sheet

Use these as themes for naming cycles. Pick the one that best matches the *vibe* of the work you’re doing in that round.

## 🌱 Early Stage
- **Seeding** → first drafts, stubs, scaffolding.  
- **Sprouting** → adding a few more files, giving shape.  
- **Scaffolding** → structuring folders, docs, indexes.  

## 🛠️ Refinement
- **Refinement** → editing drafts, tightening cross-links.  
- **Polish** → making language, visuals, or docs cleaner.  
- **Stabilization** → fixing imports, errors, structure issues.  

## 🔮 Expansion
- **Expansion** → adding whole new crates, series, or templates.  
- **Branching** → trying new directions, experiments, spinoffs.  
- **Deepening** → going deeper into one pillar (sound/poetry/visuals).  

## 🌐 Cross-Pollination
- **Cross-Linking** → weaving connections between pillars.  
- **Integration** → tying lab outputs to other repos or systems.  
- **Fusion** → combining mediums (poem + patch + visual).  

## ⚡ Momentum
- **Flow** → quick cycles of commits with light energy.  
- **Ritual** → establishing repeatable practices (patch log, templates).  
- **Harvest** → pulling outputs together for sharing/publishing.
