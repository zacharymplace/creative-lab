*Tags: #visuals #obs #streaming #design*  

---

## 🎬 Overlay States
- **Starting Soon** → Animated intro loop (soft motion, muted colors).  
- **Just Chatting** → Clean layout, room for chat window + camera.  
- **Intermission / Break** → Music bed, subtle animation, timer optional.  
- **Live / Performance** → Full focus on sound + visuals, minimal text.  
- **Ending / Thanks** → Static or slow-fade outro with links.

## 🖼️ Design Elements
- Fonts: Bold sans-serif for headers, lighter sans-serif for chat/notes.  
- Colors: Neutral base + accent pops (neon or warm tones).  
- Shapes: Rounded edges, subtle shadows.  
- Motion: Framer Motion-style transitions, not flashy but fluid.

## 🧰 Tools & Assets
- Software: OBS Studio, Photoshop/Affinity, Figma.  
- Sources: Unsplash textures, synthwave grids, personal photos.  
- Future: custom animations (After Effects / Blender).

## 💡 Ideas to Explore
- Integrate **song/track info** dynamically.  
- Build **“mood-matched” color schemes** per set or playlist.  
- Overlay interactive visuals tied to BPM or audio signals.  
- Keep assets modular → easy to swap for events (hosting vs streaming).
