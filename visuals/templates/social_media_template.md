A reusable template for creating post graphics, cover art, and other shareable visuals.  
Keep it flexible, modular, and aligned with Creative Lab aesthetics.

## 📏 Layout Specs
- **Aspect Ratios:**  
  - Square → 1080x1080 (Instagram / LinkedIn)  
  - Portrait → 1080x1350 (IG feed optimal)  
  - Story / Reel → 1080x1920  
- **Safe Area:**  
  - Leave 150–200px padding top/bottom for platform UI.

## 🎨 Style Guide
- **Base Palettes:** see [Reset Palette Moodboard](../moodboards/reset_palette.md)  
- **Typography:**  
  - Headers: Bold sans (e.g., Inter, Montserrat)  
  - Body: Geometric sans (e.g., Source Sans, IBM Plex Sans)  
- **Accents:** one highlight color per design  
- **Textures:** subtle grain/noise overlays (8–12% opacity)  

---

## 🖼️ Components
- Title Block (top or center aligned)  
- Quote/Fragment Box (example: from [One-Liners](../../poetry/fragments/one_liners.md))  
- Accent Shape (circle, bar, neon stripe, or gradient overlay)  
- Footer Info (links, handle, logo mark optional)

## 💡 Usage Examples
- **Poetry Posts:** pair short fragments with background gradients.  
- **Crate Covers:** bold title + abstract texture (linked to sound vibe).

## 📓 Notes
- Maintain consistency across series (Creative Recovery, Systems as Poetry).  
- Version control graphics like code: iterate, commit, refine.  
- Keep templates modular so palettes/quotes can swap easily.

⚡ *Goal: reduce friction — make visuals as easy to start as writing a post draft.*
